# Mamukka-lalettan-classifier
This is a web app to classify whether an image is of Mamukka or Lalettan. The user need to input a image and the web app will predict that whether the image is of Mammuka or Lalattan.We have trained a CNN model for making the predictions. This Project is created as a Part of *TinkerHub Build-From-Home*.
